Q: How can multiple users find the conversations they're invited ?
For simple fix, get the userId, then find all the conversation ID including that user ID
But can turn into a graph problem OR use Union Find for faster grouping ? (Ideas)
But now it can talk to each other 

B: Only show the text when click the conversationId button => Need to use WebSocket
